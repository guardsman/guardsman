# Contributing to Guardsman

**Please note:** Guardsman is not an input validation library, requests to add
checks like `isCreditCard()` or `isEmail()` will not be accepted. Instead create
value objects that represent such types and type hint on those instead.

To contribute:

1. Open a pull request from a feature branch on your fork.

1. Provide unit tests.

1. Follow the coding style guide using [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org) and the `.php_cs` config file.
